//==================================================================================
// The first set of API calls provide a simple interface to find and get a file from
// an AirStashÂ® device, or to save a file to a user chosen directory on an AirStash.
// The second set of API calls provide a set of building blocks an app can use to get
// information about AirStash devices found on the Wi-Fi network, and to save and load
// files to a specific location on a selected AirStash. These functions allow the app
// to provide its own user interface to perform the operations.
//
//==================================================================================
// Simple Interface:
// These functions use a UINavigationController and UITableViewController to present
// a list of AirStash devices found via Wi-Fi, and the directory contents as the user
// navigates the directory structure. The last functions in this group of functions
// Allows the user to select a file, but rather than downloading the file, a URL to
// access the file is returned. This method should be used when the app wants to
// handle the download. For example, to stream the file, or only read portions of the
// file.

// loadFileTo:...
// Present an interface to the user to select a file on an AirStash device,
// and transfer the file to the destination file path on this iOS device. 
// On success, the success block is called with the original filename (no path)
// on the AirStash device.
// If an error is detected, or the user cancels the operation, the error
// block is called with a corresponding non-zero status value, and a string
// describing the reason. The optional regular expression is used to limit
// the files that the user may select. It should match the files that may be selected.
// The parentViewController is used to modally present the UI to the user.

// Present an interface to the user to select where the given file should
// be stored on an AirStash device. The localFilePath is the path to the file 
// to be saved on the AirStash. The last path component of the path will be used
// as the filename on the destination AirStash. On success, the successBlock
// will be called. If an error is detected, or the user cancels the operation, 
// the errorBlock is called with a corresponding non-zero status value and a string
// describing the reason. The parentViewController is used to modally present
// the UI to the user.
